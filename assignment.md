# Kotlin Essentials (Data Structure /Scope Functions)
---
The Kotlin assignment has three components
- Practice with Scope Functions.
- Practice with Lists and Sets.
- Practice with Maps.

> Note: You must save your solution as `solution_part1.kt` for Part I, `solution_part2.kt` for Part II, and `solution_part3.kt` for Part III.

## Part I - with Scope Functions.
---
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Let'
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Run'  (Optional to do = Bonus!!)
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Also'  (Optional to do = Bonus!!)

## Part II - Practice with Lists and Sets.
---
- Create a list and access it and print it, then update or add elements to it
- Create a list and access out of its bounds, then manage the array errors safety with 3 different ways
- Create a list then add repetitive and unique elements to it, then convert it to set, then add new elements to it and print the set values

## Part III - Practice with Maps.
---
- Write an asnwer to this question: What are the cases that I need to use the map for?? 
- ANSWER: To know the directions sense that every street at the city have a different name so, we can arrive to our destination easily just like the map idea at Kotlin. 

- What is the difference between immutable and read only variables?
- ANSWER: ReadOnlyDictionary can be initialized once by a constructor, so you can't add or remove items from it. It's useful if you want to ensure that 
  it won't be modified while it's sent across multiple layers of your application.
  But, ImmutableDictionary has methods to modify it like Add or Remove, so they will create a new dictionary and return that 
  the original one remains unchanged and the copy of the new immutable dictionary is returned.

- Create a map of 20 elements of strings and doubles
